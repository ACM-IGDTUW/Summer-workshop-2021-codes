# Description

This session was about handling records in Pandas

An addendum to the above session is: one drawback of apply function in pandas is, you cannot see the progress. Whereas you can easily see the progress when you do it through loops (but that slows down the program). Hence, [one solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34365537/2374691) to this problem is using tqdm library. It is a very good library if you want to visualize your progress.
