That doesn't mean that there is not a lot of interesting stuff going on.\\n\\nI think that the work being done on BERT and GPT-2 is exciting.  There are new representations in them that maintain state and context.  That's a significant step towards AI.  \\n\\nThere is really interesting reinforcement learning areas, such as AlphaStar and Open AI Five, along with things like ML-Agents and systems that operate closer to the real world (long way to go, but still).   Using curiosity and prediction as internally driven reward signals allows RL systems to beat Montezuma's revenge;  that's pretty cool stuff.  That's applicable to real-life robots. \\n\\nGANs and VAEs are making interesting strides.   [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) does not excite you?   Really awesome style transfer and nvidias sketch to image stuff isn't interesting?\\n\\nEven the stuff that is 'merely' building on existing ML stuff, like really good pose estimation, understanding adversarial images, combining text and images, and visualizing / understanding what is going on inside the networks is all significant advances over 2 years ago.  \\n\\nCutting edge right now is combining NN and symbolic info (see Tenenbaums work, [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJgMlhRctm](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJgMlhRctm)) and incorporating common sense reasoning ([https://www.darpa.mil/program/machine-common-sense](https://www.darpa.mil/program/machine-common-sense) and [https://mosaic.allenai.org/](https://mosaic.allenai.org/)).

E.g. 1 week later. October 17, 2018: [https://twitter.com/GreatCrashO2018/status/1095006287853731841 ](https://twitter.com/GreatCrashO2018/status/1095006287853731841)\\n\\nThe Wyoming Steel shell company claims to be a Real Estate venture, but unlike Musk\\'s other real estate LLCs, a different manager was used then Jared Birchal, Musk\\'s usual home office wealth manager (who had power of attorney for the 5 mansions Musk mortgaged December 18th after being accused of misappropriation of SpaceX funds on 12/17 in the WSJ [https://www.sutori.com/story/event-horizon-timeline-of-the-elon-musk-empire--81ZKKUvZmyk3HSei1qWuAwps](https://www.sutori.com/story/event-horizon-timeline-of-the-elon-musk-empire--81ZKKUvZmyk3HSei1qWuAwps)).\\n\\nOther odd, recently founded Musk associated shell companies include a second \"TBC - The Boring Company\" founded in Oregon by the TBC Boring HR rep. on 10/11 (the day after Open AI registered SummerSafe as a CA company) as a completely separate company from the Delaware \"TBC - The Boring Company!\" May have nothing to do w/OpenAI, more likely to do with missing Model 3 VINs [https://twitter.com/GreatCrashO2018/status/1092672336661307392](https://twitter.com/GreatCrashO2018/status/1092672336661307392)\\n\\nThe day before the $420 Funding Secured tweet by Elon Musk 8/6/18, TBC also created a subsidiary Bastooks, LLC [https://twitter.com/greatcrasho2018/status/1094269685053444096](https://twitter.com/greatcrasho2018/status/1094269685053444096) (Bastook means a type of Jar in colloquial Arabic, where Musk had visited Israel/Jordan in the 1st part of 2018- cookies jar? ).\\n\\nIf any of these shell companies have invested in OpenAI or what would prove even worse have acted as customers for Open AI AKA SummerSafe LP services in the last 6 months where an incompetent auto CEO needed all the help with crisis PR he could get, rest assured this isn\\'t going away unless these developments are wholly unrelated. \\n\\nOpenAI is not helping itself by being coy about having founded their private company 6 months ago, and only revealing this after taking recently about creating a language model that needs be classified like a munition or something. Exactly the AI tools, were I Elon Musk, would be looking for after thinking about the successes of Russia in helping manipulate the US public to elect an incompetent at business, blustery idiot just like myself. Not saying this happened at all, but saying, having your 1st $10 million in non-profit funding come from Musk means not excluding any length hypothetically Musk might have gone to for PR manipulation. \\n\\nIf Open AI has investments or has provided services to these subsidiaries, offshore Cayman Islands companies or other Musk empire companies, I would suggest you might receive undesired attention this year or in coming ones when those with subpoena and warrant power find out whatever Musk has been hiding. I would suggest cooperating with the IRS, SEC, FBI, state Attorney generals etc and telling them what you know now, rather than waiting for them to come to you knocking on the door, a WSJ article, or waiting for a subpoena to appear before Congress after Tesla etc. collapses. \\n\\nIs the timing of going public with this, related at all to Musk about to lose the ability to raise money for all his companies via public or limited private offerings under bad actor clauses of securities laws? Same day he is filing a SEC contempt response? Granted OpenAI has its own objectives...but Musk is in a world of financial liquidity hurt, both private and corporate (paper wealth doesn\\'t mean much if you can\\'t sell without a margin call or tanking your long overvalued growth stock that\\'s no longer growing.) \\n\\nFrom the perspective of Tesla\\'s over hype of Autopilot that has led to unnecessary death and injury, how about just starting from the perspective of taking a stand on misuse of AI qua hype a product that can kill people? How about that conflict of interest in the here and now, versus AGI Killer Terminators making the human race extinct in the year 2080? (JHC, Musk papered over not putting cheapie rain sensors in his Model 3 for auto-wiping capabilities and claims to have a neural net detection always 3 to 6 months away from perfection. SW is not always the logical solution, as enamored as I am personally with it. Snakeoil salesman have no end of promises.) \\n\\nYou want to distance yourself from him for a reason, right? (Or should I be wondering if this turn towards for-profit was the plan from the get go, and then he set too many metaphorical &amp; if you follow the mismanagement of Fremont factory negligent fires to continue with the original plan?). I\\'m still in disbelief how much this charlatan walks on water, and has gotten slap on the wrists so far for what should be punished as felony crimes, but it\\'s not going to last, in Sili-valley or anywhere else, because of the chain of lies falling like dominoes. \\n\\nIf Open AI employees know about any social media manipulation/technologically advanced astroturfing or interest in the same etc. by Musk using GPT-2 or equivalents, I\\'d like to know the plan for fighting the use of deep fakes, whether textual, image, or audio- whatever media to deceive customers, stock holders and general public into thinking this genius of social engineering/credit taking/cult formation is a genius, full stop (when he\\'s no Kurzweil, not even Kurzweil Jr. - just an entitled prick w/FU money from the last bubble before the next one about to detonate). \\n\\nI\\'m not convinced that the Donald Trump of Silicon Valley \\\\*only\\\\* asked for a bailout of his reckless Autopilot team from OpenAI by poaching Karpathy when the adults on the team didn\\'t agree to his laissez-value-of-life approaches to roll out and left with their ethics intact (for which they should be applauded). \\n\\nI think Musk would realize the potential of developments like GPT-2 to keep on his unending media blitz and magnify his misinformation campaigns. If you think Musk is Tony Stark but have never heard him speak much, trying listening to a Tesla conference call, or other recent public events were he comes off as having \"problems\": [https://twitter.com/PlugInFUD/status/1105228434068918272](https://twitter.com/PlugInFUD/status/1105228434068918272) Is this your god? (Should I wonder about Deep RL wash trading agents too? What other company could suffer the missteps of Tesla and still be this overvalued- disclosure: evil Big Oil short, since that\\'s part of his Trumpian social manipulation of discourse to demonize anyone who questions him. There\\'s something fishy going on, and not just the usual Wall Street shenanigans of screwing over retail investors and leaving them bag holding ) \\n\\nJust want to know. What \\\\*if any\\\\* other \"indecent proposals\" were made, that OpenAI threw Elon Musk off the board? \\\\*If\\\\* there was - maybe he was too busy selling flamethrowers to order to fight global warming such as commuting by jet practically every other day. \\\\*If \\\\* Musk or his empire has been a client of the new for-profit OpenAI...Get in front of it, or have my PIs or the investigative journalists I provide my data free of charge to, find out what went on.
